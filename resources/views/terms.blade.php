                    <p>These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of Okacrm websites, applications, content workflows, integrations, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not access or use the Service.</p>
                    <p>Account Eligibility requires that influencer users maintain valid credentials and, where required, a compatible Instagram Professional account for primary platform authentication. Client users must access the Service only through invitation-based client portal credentials issued by an authorized influencer workspace.</p>

                    <p>You are responsible for all activity occurring under your credentials, including actions by team members, contractors, agents, and client users who access your workspace or linked records through your authorization. You must maintain accurate account information, use reasonable security practices, and promptly notify us of suspected unauthorized access.</p>
                    <p>We may require additional verification, suspend access, rotate credentials, or restrict integrations when we reasonably believe account activity presents fraud, abuse, security, legal, or operational risk.</p>

                    <p>The Service supports account connectivity, media and analytics synchronization, campaign linking, proposal workflows, invoicing workflows, and client portal visibility according to feature availability. Scheduled post functionality in the Service is for planning and tracking and does not guarantee direct publishing to external platforms unless explicitly offered in writing.</p>
                    <p>Features may evolve, be modified, or be discontinued. We may impose usage limits, storage limits, API call limits, and workflow throttles necessary to preserve availability, security, and service quality.</p>

                    <p>The Service depends on third-party providers including, without limitation, Meta/Instagram and TikTok. Your use of those providers is subject to their independent terms, policies, and technical constraints. Okacrm is not responsible for provider outages, API deprecations, policy changes, account restrictions, data delays, or downstream decisions made by those providers.</p>
                    <p>You authorize us to access and process third-party account data made available through your approved integrations. You represent that you have all rights and permissions necessary to grant this authorization.</p>

You represent and warrant that your content and conduct comply with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, platform rules, intellectual property rights, privacy rights, advertising standards, and payment obligations.</p>
                    <p>You will not submit unlawful, misleading, infringing, defamatory, deceptive, malicious, or otherwise prohibited materials. We may remove content, block actions, or suspend access when we reasonably believe these Terms or applicable legal obligations may be violated.</p>
